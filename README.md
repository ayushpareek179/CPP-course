# C++ Course

This repository contains demonstration and practice files from the [C++ course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-deep-dive/) by Mr Abdul Bari. 

## Description
The course addresses the requisite basic concepts of [C++ programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and was 
hence underwent in order to strengthen and formalize what I had known beforehand. The folders have been named as per the sections
in the original course. Thus, **Part_Fifteen** corresponds to the fifteenth section.

Please note that the programs may not map with _all_ examples depicted in the course. There are additional demonstrations, while a few have been left out for being extremely intuitive.
